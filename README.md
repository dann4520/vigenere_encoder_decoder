# vigenere_encoder_decoder
Encoder/decoder based on the Vigenere Cipher

Encoding:
User will be prompted to enter a message they wish to encode and a keyword used to encode the message.
Program will return encoded message.

Decoding:
User will be prompted to enter the message they wish decoded and the keyword used to decode the message.
If correct keyword is entered decoded message will be returned.
If incorrect encoded message or keyword is entered jibberish will be returned.

Encoder will discard any punctiation (i.e. "." "!" "?").  In fact it will discard anything entered which is not an alpha chracter or a space(" ").
